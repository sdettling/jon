#  NOTE FOR UPGRADING FROM PRE-3.0 VERSION       #
##################################################

Paperclip 3.0 introduces a non-backward compatible change in your attachment
path. This will help to prevent attachment name clashes when you have
multiple attachments with the same name. If you didn't alter your
attachment's path and are using Paperclip's default, you'll have to add
`:path` and `:url` to your `has_attached_file` definition. For example:

    has_attached_file :avatar,
      :path => ":rails_root/public/system/:attachment/:id/:style/:filename",
      :url => "/system/:attachment/:id/:style/:filename"
